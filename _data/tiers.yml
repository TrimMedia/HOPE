            It really changed my whole total outlook on the world. Before I came 
            to leadership I was a horrible person, and now since leadership I’ve 
            been better than ever.

            They found a voice and they found a purpose that I think they 
            otherwise would not have had, and it started with us having confidence 
            in them. I am really grateful to have been a part of this and I know 
            it’s changing their lives.

            Before leadership academy I didn’t feel like I couldn't do anything about 
            bullying. I didn’t feel like what I said mattered. Now, after leadership 
            academy, I see that I am powerful, that what I say matters, that people 
            will listen, and that I can make a difference.
